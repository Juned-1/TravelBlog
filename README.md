# Travel Blogging (TripNW)

Travel Blog is a dynamic single-page web application designed for travel enthusiasts to read
and write their travel experiences with the world. It provides an engaging platform where users
can create and organize their travel posts in a structured format, making it easier for others to
discover and enjoy their stories. Unlike general social media platforms, Travel Blog focuses
specifically on travel blogging, ensuring that articles are well-organized and optimized for search
engine indexing.
When users visit the Travel Blog website, they are greeted with the home page displaying recent
posts. The toolbar includes login and signup buttons, directing users to the respective pages. If a
user is not registered, the signup process will guide them through entering their details and
verifying their information. Successful registration automatically logs the user in and redirects
them to the home page. If there are any issues during the signup, such as already registered emails
or invalid data, appropriate notifications will be displayed. The application supports traditional
email and password login, third-party login through Google, and a streamlined signup process.
New users can register by providing their details (Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Email, and
Password), and the system ensures the provided information is valid, checking for existing
registrations to avoid duplicates.
Upon logging in, users can access their blogs through the "My Blog". A floating write icon in
"My Blog" provides quick access to the text editor for creating new posts. Users can compose
detailed travel articles using a rich text editor that supports headings, subheadings, and multimedia
elements such as photos and YouTube links. The editor also includes a preview feature, allowing
users to see their posts before publishing.
Visitors can explore the content by scrolling through recent posts in descending order of date.
Although they cannot react to posts without logging in, they can still read and enjoy the articles.
Logged-in users can react to posts with likes or dislikes, can leave comments and nested replies,
fostering a vibrant community of travelers.
Logged-in users can access their profiles to view their posts, followers and they can also edit
their profile details. The users interact with other users by visiting their profile to check followers,
social account, bio, profile photo and total number of read to all of the posts of person to know
their popularity.
